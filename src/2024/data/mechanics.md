There is no limit to the number of teams that may register per school, but the number of finalists may be limited to 3 (details seen below under "Invitation to the In-Person Final Round").

# Contest Structure

The competition will be split into two rounds:

1. The Online Elimination Round
2. The In-Person Finals Round
   
Problem statements will be written in English only. Communication with judges (clarifications, etc.) will also be in English.

# Online Elimination Round

Prior to the event, a free-to-enter Online Elimination Round will be held online on Codeforces. The Online Elimination Round will consist of at least ten (10) problems and will be open from February 16, 2024 at **8:00 pm** to February 26, 2024 at **8:00 pm** with the expectation that the contestants will solve the tasks during their free time.

It is forbidden to use someone else's code and to communicate about the problems with anyone apart from your own team members.

All programming languages supported by Codeforces are allowed for the Online Elimination Round. Note, however, that the languages available for the Online Final Round will be limited to C++, Java, and Python 3 (details seen below under "Contest Environment").

Clarifications pertaining to the problems must be filed by the contestant using the clarification system made available in Codeforces.

The team must use the same Codeforces team name and Codeforces accounts submitted to the Algolympics Team.

# Invitation to the In-Person Final Round

The organizers will accommodate a maximum of twenty (20) teams for the contest.

A team that:

- satisfies all eligibility criteria,
- has not been disqualified,
- has confirmed willingness and ability to attend the Online Final Round,
- is among the top three (3) from their school, and
- satisfies either of the following conditions:
    - is the highest-scoring team in the island group their school belongs to (i.e. Luzon excluding NCR, Visayas, Mindanao) OR in NCR (if the school is based in NCR)
    - is among the top seventeen (17) teams that do not fulfill the previous condition

will be given an invitation to the Online Final Round.

Once invited, the team must confirm their attendance by responding to the invitation on or before the specified deadline. Failing to confirm by the deadline will be considered equivalent to declining to attend.

Every time a team that has been invited is disqualified or declines to attend the Online Final Round, invites may be given to newly qualifying teams as per the criteria above.

If such a situation arises that there are extra slots for another team to participate and no other team can qualify, **additional teams from a university that has reached the maximum number of teams may be given an invitation**.

# In-Person Final Round

The Online Final Round will be on **March 30, 2024**, from **1:00 PM to 6:00 PM**. The full program is included in the official invitation letter, which will include the opening ceremony, company talks, schedule for the practice round, and awarding. 

Each team is required to pay a registration fee amounting to Php 250 per person to be paid before the In-Person Final Round.

This fee may be paid through GCash, Paymaya or some other methods which we will announce in a timely manner. Options outside of these may also be considered; please contact us.

During the entire competition proper, proctors will be monitoring participants at all times. 
Competitors must notify proctors before leaving the competition grounds (the laboratory rooms) to avoid possible disqualifications. Competitors will be accompanied by a proctor when leaving the competition grounds.
Proctors do not have the right to disqualify a team if they violate any of the house rules specified in the **House Rules for In-Person Final Round** section. If any violation has occurred, the matter will be escalated to the required personnel for further discussion and evaluation.
Note that proctoring guidelines may be modified. Changes will be communicated to all registered participants in a timely manner.


# In-Person Finals Contest Proper

The contest will have at least eight (8) problems to be solved in the allotted time of five hours. The length of the contest may be altered in the event of unforeseen consequences. Should the contest duration be altered, every attempt will be made to notify contestants in a timely and uniform manner.

Submissions for judging from the teams are called runs. Submissions will be handled using the programming contest management system DOMjudge. Each run will be judged by the judges as either accepted or rejected, using the machines as specified below, and the team will be notified of the results. A rejected run will be reported as one of the following:

- compilation error (the program failed to compile)
  - includes compile time limit exceeded errors,
  - includes compile memory limit exceeded errors,
- runtime error (program terminates improperly during runtime)
  - includes memory limit exceeded errors,
  - includes stack limit exceeded errors,
- time limit exceeded (program runtime exceeds the time limit for the problem),
- wrong answer (output not correct according to the problem checker/grader), or
  - includes presentation errors (minimal errors in formatting, such as extra spaces)

Teams can also submit clarification requests to the judges using the clarification system made available as part of the contest system.

If the clarification is deemed valid, the judges will send clarification reports to the team who submitted the request. The judges may also send the report to all the participating teams if deemed necessary.

## Judge Machine Specifications

- Ubuntu 18.10
- 2 vCPUs
- 4 GB Memory
- Custom 2nd generation Intel Xeon Scalable Processors (Cascade Lake) with a
  sustained all core Turbo frequency of 3.6GHz and single core turbo frequency of up to
  3.9GHz or 1st generation Intel Xeon Platinum 8000 series (Skylake-SP) processor with a
  sustained all core Turbo frequency of up to 3.4GHz, and single core turbo frequency of
  up to 3.5 GHz.

Note that these machine specifications may be subject to change.

# Scoring

Teams are ranked according to the following criteria:

- Teams are ranked according to the most problems solved.
- Teams who solve the same number of problems are ranked according to the least penalty (defined below).
- Teams who solve the same number of problems and have the same penalty are ranked according to the least time of the first accepted run.

The penalty is defined differently for the Elimination and Final Rounds.

- For the Elimination Round, the penalty is defined as the time of the first accepted run for the problem that was solved last.
- For the Final Round, the penalty is defined as the sum of the time consumed for each problem solved. The time consumed for a solved problem is the time elapsed from the beginning of the contest to the submission of the accepted run, with an additional twenty (20) minutes for every rejected run for that problem (excluding compilation errors). There is no time consumed for a problem that is not solved.

# Disqualification

1. **Undermining the legitimacy of the contest**. Teams may be disqualified if the organizing committee reasonably believes that they have attempted to undermine the legitimacy of the competition, by engaging in activities including (but not limited to):
    1. Providing false information about themselves during registration or concerning their eligibility.
    2. Breaching or refusing to comply with the rules.
    3. Sharing or using from others, **whether intentionally or unintentionally**, any information about a task, including its content or solution, before the end of a round.
    4. Displaying behavior considered to be disruptive, unethical, or unsportsmanlike.
2. **Failing to reply**. Teams may be disqualified if they fail to respond to any request for information from the organizing committee related to Algolympics within seven days of our request or a given deadline.
3. **Change of username/team name**. The team must not change their Codeforces username/team name at any point in the contest period (from registration until the end of the on-site final round). Any username/team name change is grounds for disqualification.
4. **Change of Codeforces team**. The team members that make up the Codeforces team must not change for the duration of the competition. Any change in team composition is grounds for immediate disqualification.
5. **Reporting possible cases**. Any harassment, cheating, or violation of these terms may be reported by email to algolympics@upacm.net.
