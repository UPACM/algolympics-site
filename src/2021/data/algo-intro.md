title: "What is the Algolympics?"
---

The Algolympics is a programming competition open to all interested undergraduate students from different schools, colleges and universities across the Philippines.  It is patterned after the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ACM-ICPC), a prestigious international event organized by the Association for Computing Machinery. 

It aims to promote excellence in mathematics and computer science by encouraging students to develop their problem-solving, programming, and teamwork skills. Ultimately, it seeks to raise the standard for computer science education in the Philippines. It also serves as a medium for students and teachers from different universities to exchange information and ideas. 

For this year, the contest is divided into two parts: an elimination round and a final round. The elimination round is a free-to-enter round of Algolympics held on Codeforces, while the final round is the event where qualified teams compete for the prize, in exchange for a minimal registration fee.

The annual competition is organized  by Association for Computing Machinery UP Diliman Student Chapter (UP ACM) since 2014. UP ACM is a university-wide organization in UP Diliman, and is the first local student chapter of ACM, the worldâ€™s largest and oldest education and scientific computing society.
