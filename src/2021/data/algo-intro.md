title: "What is the Algolympics?"
---

The Algolympics is an annual intercollegiate programming competition open to all interested schools, colleges and universities in the Philippines. On its eighth year, the event is co-presented by Accenture Philippines, Calibr8, and Navitaire - an Amadeus Company. It is also sponsored by Flexisource IT.

For this year, the contest will be split into two: an elimination round and a final round. The elimination round is a free-to-enter round of Algolympics held on Codeforces while the final round is the event where teams that fit the criteria laid out in the rules and mechanics compete for the prize, in exchange for a minimal registration fee.
