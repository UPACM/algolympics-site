# Online Elimination Round

<br />
<hr />

Prior to the event, an Online Elimination Round will be held online on Codeforces. The Online Elimination Round will consist of at least ten (10) problems and will be open for February 12, 2021 at **8:00 PM** to February 22, 2021 at **8:00 PM** (11 days) with the expectation that the contestants will solve the tasks during their free time.

It is forbidden to use someone else's code and to communicate about the problems with anyone apart from your own team members.

All programming languages supported by Codeforces is allowed for the Online Elimination Round. Note however that the languages available for the On-Site Final Round will be limited to C++, Java, and Python 3 (details seen below under "Contest Environment").

The team must use the same Codeforces team name and Codeforces account submitted to the Algolympics Team.

# Invitation to the On-Site Final Round

<br />
<hr />

The teams that:

- satisfy all eligibility criteria,
- have not been disqualified,
- have confirmed willingness and ability to attend the On-Site Final Round,
- are among the top three (3) from their school, and
- are among the top twenty (20) teams satisfying all criteria above

will be given invitations to the On-Site Final Round.

Once invited, the team must confirm their attendance by responding to the invitation on or before the specified deadline. Failing to confirm by the deadline will be considered equivalent to declining to attend.

Every time a team that has been invited is disqualified or declines to attend the On-Site Final Round, invites may be given to newly qualifying teams as per the criteria above.

If such a situation arises that there are extra slots for another team to participate and no other team can qualify, **additional teams from a university that has reached the maximum number of teams may be given an invite.**

The organizers will accommodate a maximum of twenty (20) teams for the contest.

A team can be composed of 1 to 3 members and will all be competing in the same final round.

Each team is required to pay a registration fee amounting to Php 150 per person be paid before the Online Final Round.

This fee may be paid through GCash, Paymaya or some other methods which we will announce in a timely manner. Options outside of these may also be considered; please contact us.

# Contest Environment

<br />
<hr />

The programming languages for the On-Site Final Round will be restricted to the following languages:

- Java (OpenJDK "11.0.4")
  - `javac {filename}`
  - `java -Xss128m -Xmx960m -Xms960m {filename_base}`
- C++ (G++ 7.4.0)

  - `g++ -std=gnu++17 -O3 -o {filename_base}.exe {filename}`
  - `./{filename_base}.exe`

- Python 3.7.0
  - `python3 -m py_compile {filename}`
  - `python3 {filename}`

Note that we can only guarantee that all problems are solvable in C++ and Java.

Each team will be provided a single computer (workstation). Each workstation\*\* will be setup as follows:

- Sublime Text
- Eclipse
- (neo)vim

_\*\*Exact workstation specifications, along with the software versions of the editors installed, will be communicated in email before the On-Site Final Round._

Contestants are allowed to bring reference material for use during the contest proper, according to the following limitations:

- Contain up to 20 pages of reference material, machine printed on single-sided Letter (8x11 inches) or A4 size paper (210x297mm), with pages numbered on the upper right hand corner.
- May contain algorithms, code listings, hints, or any other notes.
- Each team member may have an exact copy of the reference material.
- The document must be in some type of notebook, binder, envelope, or folder with the name of the institution and team on front.

All materials will be checked before the contest proper. The materials will then be placed in the team's designated workstation for the contest proper. Scratch papers and writing materials will be provided by the organizers as needed.

Apart from the approved reference material, no other materials are allowed. Contestants are not allowed to bring any machine readable versions of software or code to the contest area. Electronic devices, such as calculators, handheld gadgets, and smart watches are similarly not allowed.

Contestants are expected to switch of all communication devices and surrender them to their respective coaches for the duration of the contest.

No hardware substitutions will be allowed (that is, teams may not bring their own equipment onto the contest floor). Teams may not substitute keyboards or other peripherals; all teams will use identical equipment, as described above, during the contest.

# Practice Session

<br />
<hr />

Prior to the contest proper, a practice session will be held for one (1) hour, in order for the contestants to be familiar with the contest environment, as well as to address any technical or logistical issues that might arise.

# On-Site Finals Contest Proper

<br />
<hr />

The contest will have at least eight (8) problems to be solved in the allotted time of five hours. The length of the contest may be altered in the event of unforeseen consequences. Should the contest duration be altered, every attempt will be made to notify contestants in a timely and uniform manner.

Submissions for judging from the teams are called runs. Submissions will be handled using the programming contest management system DOMjudge. Each run will be judged by the judges as either accepted or rejected, using machines configured in the same way as the machines used by contestants, and the team will be notified of the results. A rejected run will be reported as one of the following:

- compilation error (the program failed to compile)
  - includes compile time limit exceeded errors,
  - includes compile memory limit exceeded errors,
- runtime error (program terminates improperly during runtime)
  - includes memory limit exceeded errors,
  - includes stack limit exceeded errors,
- time limit exceeded (program runtime exceeds the time limit for the problem),
- wrong answer (output not correct according to the problem checker/grader), or
  - includes presentation errors (minimal errors in formatting, such as extra spaces)

Teams can also submit clarification requests to the judges using the clarification system made available as part of the contest system.

If the clarification is deemed valid, the judges will send clarification reports to the team who submitted the request. The judges may also send the report to all the participating teams if deemed necessary.

# Scoring

<br />
<hr />

Teams are ranked according to the number of problems solved. Teams with the same number of problems solved are then ranked according to the least total time. The total time is the sum of time consumed for each problem solved.

If a tie still exists, teams will be ranked according to the time of the first accepted run.

The time consumed for a solved problem is the time elapsed from the beginning of the contest to the submittal of the accepted run, with an additional twenty (20) minutes for every rejected run for that problem (excluding compilation errors). There is no time consumed for a problem that is not solved. A live scoreboard will be available for both the contestants and the coaches. The scoreboard will be frozen one (1) hour before the conclusion of the contest.

# Disqualification

<br />
<hr />

1. **Undermining the legitimacy of the contest.** Teams may be disqualified if the organizing committee reasonably believes that they have attempted to undermine the legitimacy of the competition, by engaging in activities including (but not limited to):

   4. Displaying behavior considered to be disruptive, unethical, or unsportsmanlike.

2. **Failing to reply.** Teams may be disqualified if they fail to respond to any request for information from the organizing committee related to Algolympics within seven days of our request or a given deadline.
3. **Change of username/team name.** The team must not change their Codeforces username/team name at any point in the contest period (from registration until the end of the on-site final round). Any username/team name change is grounds for disqualification.
4. **Change of Codeforces team.** The team members that make up the Codeforces team must not change for the duration of the competition. Any change in team composition is grounds for immediate disqualification.
5. **Reporting possible cases.** Any harassment, cheating, or violation of these terms may be reported by email to algolympics@upacm.net.
