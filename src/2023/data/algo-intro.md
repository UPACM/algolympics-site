title: "What is the Algolympics?"
---

Algolympics is a **programming competition open to all interested undergraduate students from different schools, colleges and universities across the Philippines**. It is patterned after the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ACM-ICPC), a prestigious international event organized by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). Ultimately, Algolympics seeks to raise the standard for computer science education in the country.

In its ninth and second fully-online edition, and with the theme **“Algolympics 2023: Astra”**, the competition is divided into two phases: an **elimination round from February 17-27, 2022**, and a **final round on March 25, 2022**. Teams of one to three members develop their problem-solving, programming, and teamwork skills as they solve coding problems throughout the competition. Only the **top twenty (20) teams** in the elimination round will be invited to the final round.

The annual competition has been organized by the **Association for Computing Machinery - UP Diliman Student Chapter, Inc. (UP ACM)** since 2014. UP ACM is a university-wide organization in UP Diliman, and is the first local student chapter of ACM, the world’s largest and oldest education and scientific computing society.
