In this regard, time spent away from camera range will be no more than 10 minutes at a time. Participants must ask permission from the proctor if the participant wishes to leave the range of their camera and may only do so once acknowledged. Only 1 team member may go outside of camera range at a time. Failure to return to camera view after 10 minutes will be grounds for disqualification.</p>\n<p>If a person is disconnected from the meeting, they must be back online within 15 minutes. They may be disqualified after 15 minutes, subject to the judgement of the proctors.

Submissions will be handled using the programming contest management system DOMjudge. Each run will be judged by the judges as either accepted or rejected, using the machines as specified below, and the team will be notified of the results.
